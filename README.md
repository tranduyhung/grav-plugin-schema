# Grav Schema Plugin

This plugin is a fork of [SEO plugin](https://github.com/paulmassen/grav-plugin-seo). The goal of this plugin is providing Grav users ability to add schema.org structured data markup in recommended JSON-LD format to Grav pages. Other SEO features from the original [SEO plugin](https://github.com/paulmassen/grav-plugin-seo) were removed. This plugin can be used together with other SEO plugins which don't provide schema.org support.

The plugin is still under development. Do not use it on production.
